== About the release notes

These {rnotes} are identical across all architectures, and the most recent version is always available online at {rn-url}.

Entries are only listed once but they can be referenced in several places if they are important and belong to more than one section.

Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two subsequent releases.
Certain important entries from the release notes of previous product versions are repeated.
To make these entries easier to identify, they contain a note to that effect.

However, repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only.
Therefore, if you are skipping one or more service packs, check the release notes of the skipped service packs as well.
If you are only reading the release notes of the current release, you could miss important changes.

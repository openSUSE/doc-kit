=== Support and life cycle

{product} is backed by award-winning support from {suse}, an established technology leader with a proven history of delivering enterprise-quality support services.

// bnc#821338, bnc#828478, bnc#882262
{product}{nbsp}{this-ga} has a 13-year life cycle, with 10 years of General Support and 3 years of Extended Support.
The current version ({this-sp}) will be fully maintained and supported until 6 months after the release of {product}{nbsp}{this-ga}{nbsp}{next-sp}.

If you need additional time to design, validate and test your upgrade plans, Long Term Service Pack Support can extend the support duration.
You can buy an additional 12 to 36 months in twelve month increments.
This means, you receive a total of 3 to 5 years of support per Service Pack.

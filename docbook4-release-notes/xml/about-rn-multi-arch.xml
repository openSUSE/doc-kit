 <title>About the Release Notes</title>
 <para>
  The most recent version of the &rnotes; is available online at
  <ulink url="&rn-url;"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  These &rnotes; are identical across all supported architectures.
 </para>
 <para>
  Entries can be listed multiple times if they are important and belong to
  multiple sections.
 </para>
 <para>
  Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two
  subsequent releases. Certain important entries from the release notes
  documents of previous product versions may be repeated. To make such entries
  easier to identify, they contain a note to that effect.
 </para>
 <para>
  Repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only. Therefore, if
  you are skipping one or more service packs, check the release notes of the
  skipped service packs as well. If you are only reading the release notes
  of the current release, you could miss important changes.
